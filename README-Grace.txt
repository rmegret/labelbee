Instructions to run the LabelBee web app:

The web app works withou having to run a local host library. Simply drag and drop or open the file labelBee.html into your preferred browser.

All of the code I added is on the file named ChronoControl.js. I Added comments and my name to all the 
functions I wrote in the script file.

Because the example video used for testing the web app is almost 4GB big, it will probably won't 
upload on Moodle. So I can't add it with the rest of the project's file. The name of the video that 
the web app has as default is 2_02_R_170609100000.mp4. In order for the web app to work properly, make a new file called data, and add the video there.

There is a Track json file added in folder with few annotations to view the activities's visualizations more easily. It's called Tracks-test.json.
